    <p>
        Here is a quick guide on how to make Banana Bread.<br>
        <br>
        A cross between banana bread and a drizzle cake, this easy banana loaf recipe is a quick bake that can be frozen.<br>
         It's great for using up overripe bananas, too.<br>
         <br>
        Please see below for a ingredients list and a step by step guide.

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>140g Butter, Softened.</li>
            <li>140g Caster sugar, Golden is preffered.</li>
            <li>2 Large eggs, Beaten.</li>
            <li>140g <em>Self</em>-raising flour, Sifted.</li>
            <li>2 <strong>VERY</strong> ripe Banana's.</li>
            <li>50g Icing sugar.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.</li>
            <li>Butter a 2lb loaf tin and line the base and sides with baking parchment.</li>
            <li>Cream 140g softened butter and 140g caster sugar until light and fluffy, then slowly add 2 beaten large eggs with a little of the 140g flour.</li>
            <li>Fold in the remaining flour, 1 tsp baking powder and 2 mashed bananas.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for about 50 mins, or until cooked through.<br>
                 Check the loaf at 5-min intervals from around 30-40 mins in the oven by testing it with a skewer (it should be able to be inserted and removed cleanly), as the time may vary depending on the shape of your loaf tin.</li>
            <li>Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then remove to a wire rack.</li>
            <li>Mix 50g icing sugar with 2-3 tsp water to make a runny icing.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the icing across the top of the cake and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
